# Description :
I have designed an interactive Power Bi Dashboard. Created a Custom calendar table to enable advanced time intelligence functions including YTD, QTD, MTD, and custom period comparisons. The dashboard includes interactive visuals, dynamic KPIs and user friendly navigation. Focused on creating clean DAX measures.           

# 📊 Mobile Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This Power BI report presents a detailed analysis of mobile phone sales across different regions, models, payment methods, and timeframes. It helps visualize key business metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, average price, customer ratings, and payment trends. The dashboard supports interactive filtering and comparative analysis with previous year performance.
